Path to benchmark:
Main 338
Coordinator::eval
Coordinator::execute

Recovery path:

Coordinator:recover
Benchmark::sim_crash //Virtual method, derived from ycsb or tpcc benchmark cpps.
Ycsb_benchmark::sim crash
engine::recovery
engine_api::recovery //Virtual method, derived from recovery mechanism...
	WAL, SP, LSM...and their OPT counterparts (OPT_.*)
	NOTE: Default is WAL
wal_Engine.cpp::Recovery
	Recovery Code (log undo) is from line 265 to 394. 

YCSB_benchmark.cpp line 218 is the method to use for crash simulation. it calls the above recovery path. Coordinator.h runs the core of the benchmark and the recovery should be called from there. Need to modify code to remember config, and then run the code from that.
